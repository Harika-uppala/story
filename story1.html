    <p><b>The Ring</b> is a modern horror story that originated from a Japanese novel by Koji Suzuki called "Ring" (1991). It gained widespread international recognition with the release of the Japanese film adaptation "Ringu" (1998) directed by Hideo Nakata. The story revolves around a cursed videotape that brings death to anyone who watches it.</p>
    <p align="left"><h3>Here's a summary of the story:</h3></p>
    <p>Teenage girls Katie and Becca discuss an urban legend about a cursed videotape that causes whoever watches it to perish in seven days. Katie confesses to Becca that she watched such a tape with her friends the previous weekend. That night, Katie is killed by an unseen force.</p>
    <p>At Katie's funeral, Katie's mother Ruth asks her sister Rachel, a Seattle-based journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel discovers that Katie's friends were killed in bizarre accidents on the night of her death. She also learns that Becca has been institutionalized after witnessing Katie's death. Rachel goes to the Shelter Mountain Inn, the mountain retreat where Katie and her friends watched the tape. She rents the same room, cabin 12, and watches the tape; it contains strange and frightening imagery. After the tape ends, she receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers, "seven days".</p>

    <p>Rachel recruits the help of her video analyst ex-boyfriend Noah. He watches the tape and Rachel makes him a copy so they can both investigate where it came from. Rachel begins to see images from the tape appear in the real world. She discovers hidden imagery of a lighthouse and identifies a woman on the tape: a horse breeder, Anna Morgan, who killed herself after some of her horses drowned themselves off Moesko Island. Rachel finds her son Aidan, who is also Noah's son, watching the tape.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Leaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel heads for Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard, while Noah travels to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. On the ferry to the island, a horse is spooked by Rachel and leaps to its death. On the island, she discovers Anna had an adopted girl, Samara, but Richard claims it is not true. Rachel speaks to the island physician, who explains that Anna adopted Samara due to her infertility. Samara possessed the ability to psychically etch images onto objects and into people's minds, tormenting her parents and their horses. Noah finds a psychiatric file on Samara which mentions a missing video record last seen by Richard.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>Returning to the Morgan home, Rachel finds the missing video, watching it to discover Samara explaining her powers during a therapy session. Discovering Rachel, Richard strikes her insisting that Samara is evil, and that Rachel's actions have put them all in danger before electrocuting himself in the bath. Noah arrives and he and Rachel enter the barn. In a loft converted to a bedroom to isolate Samara from the outside world, they find an image of a tree behind the wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.</p>
    <p>Rachel returns with Noah to cabin 12 at Shelter Mountain Inn, where they are led to a well beneath the floorboards. They remove the lid and Rachel is pushed inside. A hand grabs her, and Rachel experiences a vision of Anna choking and dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for seven days. Samara's body surfaces from the water. After Rachel is rescued from the well, they arrange a proper burial for Samara. Noah tells Rachel that they are now safe as more than seven days have passed since she watched the tape.</p>
    <p>Aidan then warns Rachel that it was a mistake to try to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah's seven days are up and rushes to save him, but the vengeful ghost of Samara materializes on his television screen, crawls out of it and kills him. Rachel finds his disfigured face and returns home to destroy the tape. Unable to deduce why she was spared, she realizes that the tape seen by Noah and Aidan was a copy she had created. Rachel has Aidan make a copy of the copy to show to someone else, saving him from Samara. Aidan asks Rachel what will happen to the person who watches the copy they are creating, to which Rachel does not answer.</p>
