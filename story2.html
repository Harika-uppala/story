    <p><h3>Episode 1:</h3></p>
    <p>In September 2020, Cha Hyun-Soo is a soldiers' target in what appears to be a no-man's land. One month earlier, he moved into the apartment complex Green Home where a variety of people live. Depressed and suicidal, he avoids going outside and relies on food deliveries. One night, he realizes that his ramyeon delivery was opened by his neighbor and witnesses a woman holding the head of a dead cat in the apartment next door. He rushes into his apartment but is followed by his neighbor asking for help before turning into a "glutton" monster. Meanwhile, on the ground floor, residents cannot go out of the building which is on lockdown and one of them dies in the hands of a "vampire" monster.</p>
    <p><h3>Episode 2:</h3></p>
    <p>Asleep and guarded by his upstairs neighbor Ji-soo, hikikomori Hyun-soo relives the last moments before his parents' and sister's deaths in a car crash as well as their funeral where he blames them for not leaving him enough money to survive. Sang-wook kills the "glutton" monster. Ji-soo and Jae-heon encounter the "lotus root" monster. On the ground floor, conflicts start to arise between residents as they learn more about their situation and how people turn into monsters. Hyun-Soo saves two orphan siblings (whose father was killed by the "eyeball" monster) and then is saved in return with the help of his disabled neighbor, Du-sik, but soon starts experiencing symptoms.</p>

Yi-Kung goes to the basement and tries to fix the building's electricity, only to be attacked by the "Tentacle" monster, a spider-like creature which webs her to the ceiling. Meanwhile, the survivors on the ground floor watch the national broadcast and witness in horror as the president turns into a monster, causing panic amongst the survivors. The next morning, the desperate mother Cha Jin-Ok opens the gate of the building and tries to rescue her daughter.

Now that Hyun-soo's monster identity is revealed, the survivors discuss whether or not Hyun-soo should be kicked out. Eun-Hyeok suggests they hold a poll, but the convenience store owner Seok-Hyeon insists that Hyun-soo must be kicked out. To everyone's surprise, the result of the poll is a tie, and Seok-Hyeon is furious. He suddenly gets a nosebleed, showing symptoms of turning into a monster. Thus, Hyun-soo is allowed to vote, and have himself isolated along with Seok-Hyeon. Sang-wook catches up with Yoon-Jae and beats him again, leading Yoon-Jae to seek refuge with the isolated ones.

In a burning hallway, Sang-Wook is suddenly snatched by the "Reach" monster, while Hyun-Soo is attacked by the "Speed" monster. Luckily, the monster is scared by An Gil-Seob and Park Yu-Ri. They discover that Sang-Wook is only knocked unconscious. As they retrieve him, through the diary beside the dead monster, it is revealed that the guy lost his son because he failed to save him, and that he can't let go of the guilt so that he succumbs to the monster. As Sang-Wook recovers, he continues going upstairs and reaches the locked room. Inside, he discovers the room to be a red room, finding photos of abused children - indicating that Yoon-Jae is a pedophile. Confronting Yoon-Jae downstairs, Sang-Wook goes all out on him and finally beats him to death. He takes his body outside and comes back with the body of Su-Ung and Jin-Ok's daughter. Although he wants to isolate himself outside, Jae-Heon takes him back inside. The survivors build a funeral for the dead residents. Yi-Kyung discovers that she is pregnant.

The mercenaries torture the survivors, gathering them in a boundary circle, and shoot them if they cross the line. They tell the story of how they encountered a chapel full of dead bodies, as a result of the people in there killing each other, showing how humans can be scarier than monsters.

He introduces himself as Ui-myeong, revealing himself to be a monster just like Hyun-Soo. He reveals that he is the sole survivor from the church, and that joining the mercenaries was to disguise himself. Soon, the military sends pamphlets that ask the survivors to report any infected so that they will be granted safety. Ui-myeong asks Hyun-Soo which side he will be on, once the survivors learn of the information on the pamphlet.</p>
    <p><h3>Episode 10:</h3></p>

Upon burning and killing the goo monster, Ui-myeong believes humans and monsters cannot coexist. When Sang-wook attempts to take Yu-ri outside after finding her having an asthma attack, he is stopped by Ui-myeong, who won't let them go knowing that they will be eliminated by the military during Operation Golden Hour, which would eliminate everyone and everything. Hyun-Soo allows Sang-wook to leave but this causes Ui-myeong to open fire and kill two survivors, it is only after Hyun-Soo turns into a monster that he is stopped. Du-Sik sacrifices himself to calm Hyun-Soo down. In the other room, Gil-seob peacefully dies in his sleep and is buried. However, it reveals a secret tunnel. After the bodies are buried, winter arrives, as well as the military who say the survivors will be transferred to a safety camp as well as the infected should surrender. Hyun-Soo goes to confront the military while the apartment building starts to collapse as a result of a surviving outlaw causing an explosion and Eun-hyeok is presumably killed during the collapse just as his nose starts to bleed. The survivors make it above ground after entering the tunnels and are transferred to a safety camp. Yi-Kyung decides to join the military, and advises the survivors to stay alive. Hyun-Soo wakes up in an armored vehicle after confronting the military and is greeted by Sang-wook.</p>
